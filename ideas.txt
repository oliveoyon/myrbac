Nice! These two menu items ‚Äî **Application Settings** and **Security Settings** ‚Äî open the door to some really powerful features. Here's some **"food for thought"** to help you brainstorm what you could do with them:

---

## üçΩÔ∏è `<i class="fas fa-cog"></i> Application Settings`

Think of this as the **"Control Center"** for your app.

### üí° Ideas:
1. **Site Name / Branding**
   - Change site title, logo, favicon
2. **Timezone / Locale**
   - Let users choose app timezone or default language
3. **Date/Time Format**
   - e.g., `dd-mm-yyyy` vs `mm/dd/yyyy`
4. **Theme Options**
   - Light/Dark mode, primary color settings
5. **Data Retention Policies**
   - Like: auto-delete logs after X days (tie-in with your scheduler idea!)
6. **Notification Preferences**
   - Enable/disable email alerts, system messages
7. **Backup Settings**
   - Allow enabling automatic DB/file backups (could link to Laravel's backup packages)

## üîê `<i class="fas fa-user-lock"></i> Security Settings`

Security = Trust. Here's where you make users feel safe and respected.

### üí° Ideas:
1. **Password Policy Controls**
   - Enforce minimum password length, symbols, or expiry
2. **2FA Settings**
   - Enable/disable Two-Factor Authentication (Laravel has packages for this!)
3. **Login Activity Logs**
   - Show last login IP/time, failed attempts, etc.
4. **Session Timeout**
   - Set idle timeout for auto-logout
5. **Allowed IPs**
   - Restrict access by IP (e.g., only office IPs)
6. **Email Alerts**
   - Send an email if login from a new location/device
7. **Account Locking**
   - Lock account after X failed attempts, manually unlock
8. **Audit Trail View**
   - View logs of actions by user (related to your logging system)

## üß† Pro Tips

- Store settings in a table (`settings`) with key-value pairs.
- Cache settings for performance (`Cache::remember()`).
- Use a `SettingsService` to easily retrieve values throughout your app.
